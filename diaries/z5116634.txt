Week 1

Group formed. Joined Github classroom and Jira groups. Collaborated with the rest of the group to write up a draft for the user stories. Created the git repo and uploaded a very basic frontend (incl. VSCode, npm, Typescript, and Webpack configurations) as well as a basic Django REST backend.
