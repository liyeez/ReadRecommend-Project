Week 1

Group formed. Joined Github classroom and Jira groups. Collaborated with the rest of the group to write up a draft for the user stories. Created the git repo and uploaded a very basic frontend (incl. VSCode, npm, Typescript, and Webpack configurations) as well as a basic Django REST backend.

Week 2

Worked on Technical Specifications in the Project Proposal with John. Got a basic frontend working with Monica. Expanded and clarified documentation. Added linting configurations.
