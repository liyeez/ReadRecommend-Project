# Capstone Frontend

## Specs

- Written in HTML and Typescript.
- Packages handled by npm.
- Typescript compiled and packaged by webpack.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` to get the required libraries.
2. Write code in the `src\index.html` or `src\main.ts` files.
3. Run `npm start` to build and start a local webserver on port 8080.
   - If using VSCode (which I recommend), get the "Debugger for Chrome" extension.
   - You can then use the debug inside VSCode to connect to the webserver and debug within VSCode.
   - Otherwise, use your preferred browser and connect to the webpage to debug.
   - The webserver will automatically reload the page on saved changes to the source files.
4. When you are happy with the end result, run the `deploy.py` script to upload to the online webserver.
